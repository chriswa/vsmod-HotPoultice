# vsmod-HotPoultice

This mod changes poultices to be heal-over-time (HoT) instead of instantaneous.

All poultices take 8 seconds to finish working. More powerful poultices will restore more health per tick. The total amount of healing is unchanged.

## BuffStuff

This mod mostly exists as a proof of concept and sample implementation of the [BuffStuff library](https://github.com/chriswa/vsmodlib-BuffStuff/).

BuffStuff is included as a git submodule in `src/`.
